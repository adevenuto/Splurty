  <h1>About Splurty</h1>

  <p>
    Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/MarcoMorawec">Marco</a>. Two web developers who are on a mission to give people the technical skills needed to launch their own MVPs and turn ideas into reality. Together they taught hundreds of students how to code and build products people want at places like Harvard Business School, Carnegie Mellon, Babson, Rhode Island School of Design, Brown University, Punohou High School and â€˜Iolani High School.
